# Commit and Push

When the user says "commit and push" (or similar: "commit", "push", "commit and push all"):

1. **Stage all changes**: `git add -A` or equivalent - include every modified, new, and deleted file
2. **Commit** with the user's message or an inferred one
3. **Push** to the remote

Do NOT commit only specific files (e.g. version bumps) unless the user explicitly limits scope. "Commit and push" means the entire working tree.
