# Item Descriptions — Flavor Only

Item `description` fields must be **flavor** — lore, setting, reputation. NOT mechanical stats or bonuses.

## BAD (mechanics)

- "Piston-caliber. Lowest damage, fastest cycle."
- "Heavy tank plate."
- "Reduces stun duration by 25%."

## GOOD (flavor)

- "A staple in the spec ops community."
- "Heavy harness worn by those who hold the line."
- "Legendary heavy armor."

Stats (damage, speed, toughness) and effects go in their respective boxes. The description is for vibe, not specs.
