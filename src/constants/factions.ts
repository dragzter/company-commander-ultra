Renowned for their ability to hold the line or advance under heavy fire, their infantry units are the backbone of mechanized warfare, supported by very rare armored vehicles rather than relying on them entirely. Every soldier is trained to operate autonomously but thrives in coordination with their squad, making them adaptable to any battlefield scenario. They pride themselves on their unshakable resolve and cold, efficient tactics.",

Their sole focus is economic dominanceâ€”hoarding wealth, resources, and strategic leverage through raids, theft, and calculated alliances. They fight only when necessary, preferring to manipulate others into exhausting their strength first. Despite their disparate origins, they function with surprising cohesion, guided by a code of efficiency, survival, and cold calculation.  The Scarlet Accord is a melting pot of recruits from various backgrounds, united by shared ruthlessness and ambition. Their structure blends military precision with the loose hierarchy of a criminal syndicate, making them adaptable and deadly in equal measure.",
